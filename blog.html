            <p class="fs-5">The difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page
            session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and
            assigned to that particular tab.</p>

            <p class="fs-5"><strong>Arrow Function: </strong>arrow functions do not have their own this . The value of this
                inside an arrow function remains the same throughout the
                lifecycle of the function and is always bound to the value of this in the closest non-arrow parent function

                <strong>Var: </strong>It can be declared without initialization.In JavaScript, var is a reserved keyword
                which is followed by a reference variable name. The name defined after the
                keyword can then be used as a pointer to the data in-memory. <br>
                <strong>let: </strong>It can be declared without initialization. The let declaration was introduced with ES6
                and has since become the preferred method for variable declaration. It is
                regarded as an improvement over var declarations and is block-scoped (variables that can be accessed only in
                the
                immediate block), circumventing the main issue that can arise with using var. <br>
                <strong>const: </strong>It cannot be declared without initialization.The const declaration was introduced
                with ES6, alongside let, and it is very similar to let. const points to data in
                memory that holds constant values, as the name implies. const reference variables cannot be reassigned to a
                different
                object in memory
