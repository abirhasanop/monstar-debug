            <p class="fs-5">The difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page
            session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and
            assigned to that particular tab.</p>

                <h2>What is difference between block scope and global scope?</h2>
            </header>
            <p class="fs-5">The Javascript global scope is the context where everything in a Javascript program executes by default. This scope
            includes all variables, objects, and references that are not contained within a customized scope defined by a
            programmer. Global scope is the entire Javascript execution environment. Block scope restricts the variable that is
            declared inside a specific block, from access by the outside of the block. The let & const keyword facilitates the
            variables to be block scoped. In order to access the variables of that specific block, we need to create an object for
            it.

                <h2>What is Event loop in JavaScript?</h2>
            </header>
            <p class="fs-5">The Event Loop monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the
            first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a
            tick in the Event Loop
